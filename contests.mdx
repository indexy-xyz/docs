## What's a Contest?

A contest is a skill-based tournament where users build a crypto index and compete against others. Performance is tracked in real time and compared on a leaderboard. Winners receive rewards in \$i (Indexy’s token).

Contests have a start and end date and can be free to enter or require a ticket fee, paid in \$i or USDC.

## Rules

### Index requirements:

Valid indexes should meet the following rules

- Minimum 3 coins, and maximum 10 coins
- Minimum allocation 1 percent per coin
- Total allocation 100 percent

### Scoring:

Each index performance is measured with a BPS (Base Performance Score), which starts at 100 BPS. A 1 percent performance change equals 1 BPS.

Contest formats may include constraints such as:

- Only certain blockchains allowed
- Limits on number of tokens
- Market cap, FDV, or asset age restrictions

### Entry types:

- Free contests
- Paid contests where entry fees increase the prize pool

4. Choose between 3 and 10 coins
5. Assign weights with a minimum of 1 percent each, total must equal 100 percent

## Leaderboards

The leaderboard updates in real time during the contest. It shows your index performance as a BPS score, other participants’ performance, and the strategies they submitted.

You can track your relative position at any time.

## Rewards

Winners receive rewards in i, with prize pools depending on the contest format. Free contests use a fixed reward pool, while paid contests add entry fees to increase the pool. All rewards are distributed after the contest ends (after the review phase) into your Indexy Wallet.
