## What's a Contest?

A contest is a skill-based tournament where users build a crypto index and compete against others. Performance is tracked in real time and compared on a leaderboard. Winners receive rewards in \$i (Indexy’s token).

Contests have a start and end date and can be free to enter or require a ticket fee, paid in \$i or USDC. 

## Rules

### Index requirements:

Valid indexes should meet the following rules

- Minimum 3 coins, and maximum 10 coins
- Minimum allocation 1 percent per coin
- Total allocation 100 percent

### Scoring:

Each index performance is measured with a BPS (Base Performance Score), which starts at 100 BPS. A 1 percent performance change equals 1 BPS.

Contest formats may include constraints such as:

- Only certain blockchains allowed
- Limits on number of tokens
- Market cap, FDV, or asset age restrictions
