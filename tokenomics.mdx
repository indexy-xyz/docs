title: "Tokenomics V1"
description: "Learn about $i tokenomics"
---

The **\$i** token was introduced through a fair launch using Clanker Launcher. As a result, all information about token holders and token distribution is publicly available on the blockchain.

In this first version of the tokenomics, we have organized and shared the distribution structure of \$i for easy reference.

## Philosophy

The \$i tokenomics were designed with long-term viability in mind. A significant portion of the supply has been reserved in the Treasury to ensure flexibility for Indexy's evolution, future design, and strategic needs such as growth, partnerships, capital support or team expansion.

## Out of Circulation

### Treasury - 30%

The treasury is currently out of circulation and reserved for future development and strategic use.

## Circulating Supply

### Community - 54%

Held by the community, these tokens were acquired openly on the market.

### Liquidity Pools - 8%

Approximately 8% of the supply is currently in liquidity pools across Uniswap and Aerodrome. The majority is allocated to the [Indexy and Clanker LP](https://dexscreener.com/base/0x87c0676255be413399c9a205d9cbeb2a04814cca). Additional allocations could be made from the Treasury if needed to ensure sustainability.

### Team - 4%

Allocated to the founding team and future collaborators. Additional allocations could be made from the Treasury if needed to support long-term team growth and sustainability.

### Operations - 2%

Designated for operational expenses, including costs and activities required to run Indexy. Additional allocations could be made from the Treasury if needed to ensure sustainability.

## Closing Note

This Tokenomics V1 structure reflects the current state of distribution. Allocations may evolve in future versions as Indexy grows and adapts to new opportunities, community needs, and strategic priorities.
