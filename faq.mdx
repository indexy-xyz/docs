### **What is Indexy?**

### **What is an Index?**

An **index** is a weighted collection of assets (usually stocks) that represents a segment of the financial market. For example, the **S&P 500** tracks the performance of 500 large U.S. companies, giving a snapshot of the broader U.S. stock market.

- **Discovery**: Helps investors understand and follow a specific sector or market (e.g., tech, energy, emerging markets).
- **Diversification**: Reduces risk by spreading exposure across multiple assets rather than betting on one.
- **Benchmarking**: Serves as a performance baseline for investors or funds to compare their returns against indices.
- **Passive Investing**: Many investors buy index funds to gain broad exposure without picking individual assets.
- **Market Trends**: Offers insight into the health or momentum of a specific sector or the overall market.

Indexy applies this concept to digital assets.
